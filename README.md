# VirtualJV

JV-880 emulator, as VST/AU plugin. Based on [NukeYKT's SC55](https://github.com/nukeykt/Nuked-SC55).

You'll need ROMs to use this software. During the first run you will be able to open the destination ROM folder. Copy your ROMs there, restart the plugin, and wait for a minute for the first load to happen. Have fun!
